# Javascript chess variants

A short, fun highschool html/javascript project based on http://www.tckerrigan.com/Chess/TSCP/ implementing the chess variants (like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EuroShogi).  
The file game.html is meant to be embedded into an iframe.
  
The goal is just to contribute a tiny bit to the TSCP community by providing javascript chess variants.
  
Current bugs/todos:  
 - the design is unresponsive  
 - the translations were lost with some encoding
